- üåê **Network Support**: Scan single hosts or entire networks (CIDR notation)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**: CVE checking and service fingerprinting
- üìä **Flexible Output**: JSON and plain text output formats
- üéÆ **Advanced Controls**: 
  - Custom port ranges
  - Random port scanning
  - Configurable timeouts and retries
  - Fragment size control
  - Ping sweep capability

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/seeyou
```

Or clone and build manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seeyou.git
cd seeyou
go build
```

## Usage

Basic scan:
```bash
./seeyou -host example.com
```

Scan specific ports:
```bash
./seeyou -host example.com -p 80,443,8080
```

Scan port range:
```bash
./seeyou -host example.com -p 1-1000
```

Scan all ports:
```bash
./seeyou -host example.com -all
```

Network scan:
```bash
./seeyou -host 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22,80,443
```

Advanced scan with service detection:
```bash
./seeyou -host example.com -sV -banner -fp -cve -json -out results.json
```
